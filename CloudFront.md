# Enhancing CloudFront Security Using AWS Console

To enhance the security of your CloudFront distribution using the AWS Console, follow these best practices:

## 1. Enable HTTPS (SSL/TLS) for CloudFront Distribution
- **Step 1**: Go to the AWS Console and navigate to **CloudFront**.
- **Step 2**: Select your distribution.
- **Step 3**: Under the **General** tab, ensure that **Viewer Protocol Policy** is set to **Redirect HTTP to HTTPS** or **HTTPS Only**.
- **Step 4**: If you haven’t already, request an SSL/TLS certificate from AWS ACM (Amazon Certificate Manager) for your domain.
- **Step 5**: Under **SSL Certificate**, select **Custom SSL Certificate** and choose the ACM certificate you’ve requested.

## 2. Use Signed URLs or Cookies
- **Step 1**: Go to **CloudFront** in the AWS Console.
- **Step 2**: In your distribution settings, choose **Restrictions**.
- **Step 3**: Enable **Signed URLs** or **Signed Cookies** and associate them with the corresponding key pair or AWS IAM role for access control.

## 3. Enable Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- **Step 1**: Navigate to **WAF & Shield** in the AWS Console.
- **Step 2**: Create a WAF WebACL (Access Control List).
- **Step 3**: Define your rules (e.g., IP allow/deny list, SQL injection protection).
- **Step 4**: Associate the WAF WebACL with your CloudFront distribution.

## 4. Enable Logging
- **Step 1**: In the **CloudFront** console, go to your distribution settings.
- **Step 2**: Under the **General** tab, enable **Logging**.
- **Step 3**: Choose an S3 bucket where the logs will be stored. Ensure that the S3 bucket is secure and has appropriate access policies.

## 5. Restrict Access Using Geolocation
- **Step 1**: In the **CloudFront** console, go to your distribution.
- **Step 2**: Under **Restrictions**, enable **Geo-Restriction**.
- **Step 3**: Select **Whitelist** or **Blacklist** countries as per your requirement.

## 6. Enable Origin Access Identity (OAI)
- **Step 1**: In **CloudFront**, navigate to the **Origins** section of your distribution.
- **Step 2**: Select your S3 origin and click **Edit**.
- **Step 3**: Under **Restrict Bucket Access**, select **Yes**.
- **Step 4**: Create a new **OAI** or select an existing one to ensure that only CloudFront can access the S3 bucket content.

## 7. Use Custom Headers for Security
- **Step 1**: Go to your **CloudFront** distribution.
- **Step 2**: Under **Behaviors**, choose the behavior to apply custom headers to.
- **Step 3**: Edit the behavior and configure **Cache Based on Selected Request Headers** as required.
- **Step 4**: Set custom headers in the **Origin Response** or **Viewer Response**.

## 8. Limit Allowed HTTP Methods
- **Step 1**: Go to **CloudFront**.
- **Step 2**: Choose the distribution and navigate to the **Behaviors** tab.
- **Step 3**: Select the behavior you want to modify and click **Edit**.
- **Step 4**: Under **Allowed HTTP Methods**, select only the methods you need (e.g., GET, HEAD for read-only operations).

## 9. Enable DDoS Protection Using AWS Shield
- **Step 1**: In the AWS Console, go to **AWS Shield** and ensure **Shield Standard** is enabled for your distribution.
- **Step 2**: For enhanced protection, use **AWS Shield Advanced**.

## 10. Monitor CloudFront Metrics with CloudWatch
- **Step 1**: Go to **CloudWatch** in the AWS Console.
- **Step 2**: Create alarms based on CloudFront metrics like **4XX Errors**, **5XX Errors**, or **Total Requests**.
- **Step 3**: Set actions, such as sending notifications to SNS or triggering Lambda functions, if the thresholds are breached.

# Enhancing CloudFront Backup Using AWS Console

To enhance the backup for your CloudFront distribution using the AWS Console, you can implement the following strategies to ensure your content is secured and easily recoverable.

## 1. Enable CloudFront Logs for Backup
CloudFront can be configured to log all requests to your distribution. This allows you to retain access logs in an S3 bucket for auditing, analysis, or recovery purposes.

### Steps:
1. **Sign in to the AWS Management Console.**
2. **Navigate to the CloudFront Console**:
   - In the AWS Management Console, search for "CloudFront" and select it.
3. **Select your Distribution**:
   - In the CloudFront dashboard, select the distribution for which you want to enable logging.
4. **Configure Access Logs**:
   - Under the `General` tab of the distribution, find the **Logging** section.
   - Enable **Logging** and specify the S3 bucket where you want to store the logs.
   - Optionally, you can set a prefix for the log files (to organize them).
5. **Save Changes**:
   - Click **Yes, Edit** to save your changes.

This will allow you to have an ongoing backup of all CloudFront request logs in your S3 bucket.

## 2. Store CloudFront Objects in an S3 Bucket for Backup
If CloudFront is serving static content (e.g., images, videos, or documents), you can back up the content in an S3 bucket. You can configure your CloudFront distribution to pull content from an S3 bucket and back up that S3 bucket regularly.

### Steps:
1. **Create an S3 Bucket for Backup**:
   - Navigate to the **S3 Console**.
   - Click on **Create bucket**, provide a name (e.g., `my-cloudfront-backup`), and choose a region.
   - Click **Create**.
2. **Copy CloudFront Files to the S3 Bucket**:
   - You can use the AWS CLI or AWS SDKs to automate the process of copying CloudFront objects to the backup S3 bucket.
   - Example command using AWS CLI:
     ```bash
     aws s3 sync s3://my-cloudfront-content/ s3://my-cloudfront-backup/
     ```
3. **Enable Versioning for Backup**:
   - Open the S3 bucket you just created for backup.
   - Under the `Properties` tab, enable **Versioning** to keep track of different versions of objects.
   
This will ensure you have a backup of the content delivered by CloudFront.

## 3. Use CloudFormation or AWS Backup for Infrastructure Backup
CloudFormation allows you to define your CloudFront distribution and its settings as infrastructure-as-code. By maintaining CloudFormation templates, you can recreate your CloudFront distribution configuration if needed.

### Steps:
1. **Create or Export CloudFormation Template**:
   - Go to the **CloudFormation Console**.
   - Either create a new stack or export an existing stack to save the configuration.
2. **Backup CloudFormation Template**:
   - Store the CloudFormation template in a secure location, such as an S3 bucket or a version-controlled repository, to have a backup of the infrastructure.
3. **Use AWS Backup (Optional)**:
   - AWS Backup can be used to back up resources like RDS, EC2, and EFS, but it does not currently support CloudFront directly. However, you can back up the related data (S3, EC2, RDS) that CloudFront serves.

---

## 4. Monitor and Automate Recovery Using CloudWatch and Lambda
To ensure your CloudFront distribution is always backed up and properly functioning, you can use AWS CloudWatch for monitoring and AWS Lambda for automation.

### Steps:
1. **Set Up CloudWatch Monitoring**:
   - Navigate to the **CloudWatch Console**.
   - Set up custom metrics and alarms for CloudFront to track its status.
2. **Create a Lambda Function for Automated Recovery**:
   - Create a Lambda function to automate recovery or recreate the CloudFront distribution if an issue occurs.
   - You can trigger the Lambda function from CloudWatch alarms if the distribution becomes unavailable or experiences issues.

This adds an additional layer of resilience to your CloudFront distribution.

## 5. Regularly Backup DNS Records
If your CloudFront distribution is serving content from a custom domain, back up your DNS records using Route 53.

### Steps:
1. **Export DNS Records**:
   - Go to **Route 53** in the AWS Console.
   - Export or document the DNS settings that route traffic to your CloudFront distribution.
   
This ensures that you can quickly restore DNS settings if needed.
